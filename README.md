Oohhhh boy what am i doing.

Attempting blackjack in fsharp as a first real passion project and to get myself comfortable with functional concepts.

Goal is to first model the logic and then eventually find a way to do a non console frontend.  I'm ideally trying to stick to using no mutable variables and no for loops as to force myself to get used to the proper concepts/patterns.  Further an inital goal was to understand how to handle multiple files/modules in Fsharp and eventually use function types (which i should have already....but yeah).

Obviously a mess but i'm trying. A ton of the fsharp documentation is out of date, links to stuff that doesn't work, or assumes 3+ years of dev skills in a major language, and so a lot of this has just come out of the fsharp discord.
