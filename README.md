Oohhhh boy what am i doing.

Attempting blackjack in fsharp as a first real passion project and to get myself comfortable with functional concepts.

Goal is to first model the logic and then eventually find a way to do a non console frontend.  I'm ideally trying to stick to using no mutable variables and no for loops as to force myself to get used to the proper concepts/patterns.  Further an inital goal was to understand how to handle multiple files/modules in Fsharp and eventually use function types (which i should have already....but yeah).

Obviously a mess but i'm trying. A ton of the fsharp documentation is out of date, links to stuff that doesn't work, or assumes 3+ years of dev skills in a major language, and so a lot of this has just come out of the fsharp discord.


Current goals-

1. Get it playable.  Right now it deals the inital hands and displays them, but that's about it.

2. Better use of function passing. Pretty sure I could do something like List.map Deal Players to deal to my players, but i've yet to get that to work, but i'm looking to refactor into it.

3. Related to that, a more dynamic and better structured state/menu system.  Right now to prevent locking up in indecision i'm just forcing it all through, but the goal isn't to just get this to work, but to work showing off some of the better sides of fsharp/functional programming. Some commented code shows my first stabs at that, but I really need to try again.
